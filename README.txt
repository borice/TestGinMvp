This is an attempt at writing the standard GWT HelloWorld app using the GinMvp framework.
This is set up as an Eclipse project.

Known issues:
- attempting to compile the application using the GWT Compile menu option fails with error along the lines of:
  "AutoPlaceHistoryMapperGeneratedDelegate cannot be abstract"

  It works fine if you run the application in GWT hosted mode.
